🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-website.git
cd travel-website
2. Run the Backend
Based on your stack, here's a generic example (adjust accordingly):

If using Python (Flask)

bash
Copy code
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
If using Node.js

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
The backend will start on http://localhost:5000 or similar.

3. Open the Website
You can open frontend/index.html directly, or serve the frontend through the backend.

💡 Booking Functionality
Users fill out a form to book flights/hotels

Backend validates and stores the booking data

Confirmation is displayed to the user or emailed (if email integration is added)

🔐 Security Considerations
Input validation for all booking forms
